Last updated: 2025-04-25 16:00:00 -03:00

QR File Transfer (“we”, “our”, or “us”) operates the QR File Transfer mobile application (the “App”).

This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information if you choose to use our App.

📷 Camera Access
Our App may request access to your device’s camera. The App needs this permission because it needs to scan QR codes in order to receive the file data from the sender device. 
This access is used only to scan QR codes and is not used to collect, store, or share personal data.

We do not transmit any images or video captured by the camera to our servers or third parties.

🔒 Data Collection
We do not collect personally identifiable information. Any information captured using the camera remains on your device and is used only for the purpose of enabling the App’s core functionality.

📤 Third-Party Services
Our App does not use third-party services that collect data used to identify you.

📄 Use of Third-Party Services: Firebase
Our app uses services provided by Firebase (by Google LLC) to improve quality, stability, and user experience. These services may collect certain technical information from your device, but they are not used to personally identify you.

Crashlytics (Crash Reporting)
We use Firebase Crashlytics to detect and report application crashes and errors. This service collects information such as your device model, operating system version, app version, and the time of the crash. This data helps us identify and fix technical issues to improve app stability.

Google Analytics for Firebase
We also use Google Analytics for Firebase to better understand how users interact with our app. This tool collects data such as in-app events, session duration, device type, country of origin, and other anonymous usage statistics. This information helps us make informed decisions to improve the app experience.
