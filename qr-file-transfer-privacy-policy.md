Last updated: 2025-04-25 16:00:00 -03:00

QR File Transfer (“we”, “our”, or “us”) operates the QR File Transfer mobile application (the “App”).

This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information if you choose to use our App.

📷 Camera Access
Our App may request access to your device’s camera. The App needs this permission because it needs to scan QR codes in order to receive the file data from the sender device. 
This access is used only to scan QR codes and is not used to collect, store, or share personal data.

We do not transmit any images or video captured by the camera to our servers or third parties.

🔒 Data Collection
We do not collect personally identifiable information. Any information captured using the camera remains on your device and is used only for the purpose of enabling the App’s core functionality.

📤 Third-Party Services
Our App does not use third-party services that collect data used to identify you.

✅ Your Consent
By using our App, you agree to this privacy policy.

📝 Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We recommend you review this page periodically for any changes.
